# 01. Navigating an Unstructured Request

***Structured requests*** typically come with clear expectations and predefined parameters, allowing for straightforward responses. In contrast, ***unstructured requests*** require a more exploratory approach, involving deeper inquiry and customized solutions. Effective handling of both types of requests enhances your ability to deliver exceptional service and build stronger relationships with clients.

### Structured request
The client approaches you with a well-defined problem, a clear scope, and specific outcomes in mind. They are seeking a particular solution, and your role is to execute it or provide that solution based on their articulated needs.

### Unstructured Request
The client recognizes they have an issue—technical, business, or market-related—but may not have a clear idea of how to achieve the solution. They require guidance in framing the problem and devising an approach to create an appropriate solution.

## Opportunities Presented with Unstructured Requests

### 01. Early Engagement
Engaging early in the conversation allows to help the client articulate and frame their business problems. This way we can gain a thorough understanding of the client's needs, enhance its reputation, and establish itself as an integral part of the client's planning process.
During initial meetings with the client, your goal is to obtain answers to the following questions:
What is the challenge?
If we solves this challenge, what kind of outcome is the client looking for?
Why is the client seeking to engage an outside partner?
Why now? What has changed?

### 02. Strategic Partnership
When we help the client define the challenge, it shifts from just being an executor to becoming a strategic consultant. This change is crucial for being recognized as a trusted advisor who contributes value through expertise and insight, rather than merely completes assigned tasks.

### 03. Broader Opportunities
Working effectively with unstructured requests allows us to see beyond the immediate needs of the client and identify broader opportunities for collaboration. This approach helps uncover additional areas where our services can be valuable, leading to more extensive engagement with the client.

## Consultative and Client-Centric Mindsets

Now let's explore the specifics of the ***consultative*** and ***client-centric mindsets*** and discover how these approaches can help you effectively respond to unstructured requests.

These two mindsets are essential when a client approaches you without a clear request. They enable you to effectively guide the client through the process by ***actively listening***, ***asking the right questions***, and ***tailoring solutions*** that align with their specific needs.

### Client-Centric Mindset
A client-centric mindset is rooted in a deep understanding of the client's business and how they generate revenue, extending beyond just IT considerations. It involves empathizing with the client's perspective and needs, ensuring that the recommendations and solutions offered align closely with their business objectives and challenges.

### Consultative Mindset
A consultative mindset is a culture of curiosity, openness, and learning. It's a mindset that empowers you to listen, ask questions, challenge assumptions, and embrace constant improvement and change. ****Collaborating with clients to identify problems**** (***being consultative***) increases the likelihood of earning their trust and securing the opportunity to solve those problems (***engineering***).

### Humble Approach
Approaching challenges with a consultative and client-centric mindset inherently requires humility. This involves recognizing that you may not have all the answers and being open to learning from each interaction with the client. Humility allows you ****to genuinely listen and understand the client's needs and perspectives, rather than imposing solutions****.

Humility builds trust with clients. When you demonstrate genuine interest in understanding and addressing the client's needs, rather than asserting your expertise or pushing your own agenda, clients are more likely to feel respected and valued. This trust is crucial for establishing a long-term, collaborative relationship where clients views us as a trusted advisor.

# 02. Holding a Productive Meeting with a Client

- Assist the client in organizing their input and existing evidence regarding the request, the stakeholders involved, and their definition of success.
- Utilize the summarized client input to assemble the appropriate team to develop optimal solution approach.


## Research your client

### Company
- Client's place in the industry
- Scale at which they operate (market presence, number of employees)
- Recent history (leadership changes, press coverage, financial reports, etc.)
- Product offerings and value proposition
- Target market
- Organizational chart and structure
- Business strategy

### Personal 
- An individual who you will be talking to (role, place in the organization, background)
- Their history with the company or prior to joining the company

## Gather critical information

- The challenge: The issues and their symptoms, specific examples and incidents, impact on business operations, performance metrics, and overall objectives, root causes, any previous attempts taken by the client to address them
- The bigger context: Business model, industry landscape, recent changes the client has experienced, main competitors and industry trends (external pressures)
- People involved: All the stakeholders who are affected by or have influence over the problem.
- Current knowledge: What the client knows about the problem, including any data they've collected or hypotheses they have.
- Unknowns: What aspects of the problem the client feels are unclear or missing.
- Desired outcomes: The client's vision for success and how it would impact their business.

## Ask questions

Effective questions encourage the client to open up, leading to more open and productive conversations. Explore the examples below of effective questions to ask and questions to avoid during conversations with the client.

### Effective questions:
**Open-ended:** These are questions that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." They require a more detailed response and encourage deeper discussion. For example: "Why now?", "What has changed?", "Why is this an issue?", "Why is there a desire to solve this?", "How much buy-in within the organization is there to solve this?", "Have you tried to solve this before?", "Why didn't it work?", "How does this align with a bigger business strategy?", "What does success look like at the end?", "What do you need to move forward?"

**Clear:** Use simple words and avoid jargon.

**Follow-up:** These questions help you deepen your understanding of the information gathered form the client.

**Read-the-room:** Much can be understood from what isn't explicitly said. Consider asking, "Am I understanding you correctly?", "Is what I'm sharing helpful?", and "I'll repeat what I'm hearing; is this correct?"

****Questions to avoid:****
****Leading questions:**** By asking such questions, you are providing the client with the answer and not genuinely trying to understand them. Leading questions prompt a specific response, often reflecting the bias or desired outcome of the questioner. For example: ***"Given the increased demand for remote services, you've likely noticed significant customer behavior changes during the pandemic prompting an immediate shift to digital channels, haven't you?"***

### Actively listen and summarize
Listen attentively to what the client is saying and strive to understand the underlying reasons for their statements.

****Good practices:****
- Acknowledge when you don't know the answer and maintain humility
- Demonstrate curiosity and engagement. Phrases like "Tell me more about that," "I didn't know that," "That's really interesting," and "That makes sense" can be helpful.
- Show that you actively listen and understand. Use statements such as "I want to make sure I understand," and "I'm going to repeat back to you what I'm hearing."
- Provide a brief, clear, and concise summary of what the client has said
- Listen to the client's feedback and comments

****Practices to avoid:****
- Multitask during a client call
- Dominate the conversation unnecessarily

***When you ask open-ended questions and summarize what you've heard, it helps the client clearly articulate their challenges and requests. This approach will help gather relevant and valuable information that allows to take appropriate actions, develop the right solutions, and build trust with the client.***

# 03. Concluding the Meeting

## Capture the client's input

Accurately capture the client's input either by ***directly quoting their statements*** or ***by validating your summary*** of what you've heard, including known information and uncertainties. Avoid documenting your own interpretations of the client’s challenges, needs, and aspirations.

Once created, it is important to validate your summary with the client. This helps them structure their thoughts about the request and provides an opportunity for them to give feedback and point out anything you might have missed or misinterpreted. You can share your screen with the client to review the input you captured during the meeting, whether it's in a presentation, on a Miro board, or in your notes.  Your structured summary will help you later to brainstorm with your team about the best approach to present to the client.
