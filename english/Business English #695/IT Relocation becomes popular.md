**IT Relocation becomes popular**

Nowadays, relocation becomes very popular among IT specialists. In this article, I wanted to express my thoughts on it and provide some details on how to pass this process as smoothly as possible.

Initially, Iâ€™d highlight the advantages and disadvantages of relocation. On one hand, we can consider the relocation as an opportunity to grow, expand our career path, meet new people, and explore new locations and cultures. On another hand, we will run into the problems anyway.

Then, I can suggest some popular destinations for IT relocation. The next countries are growing fast in the context of the IT sector: Singapore, Malaysia, and Latin America. If you want to be integrated into the community and local culture very quickly, it might be reasonable to choose one of the countries, built by immigrants for immigrants: the USA, Canada, etc.

Finally, I want to share my opinion and my own experience in the relocation process. Even though it was the most important step in my life and, a lot of opportunity received, I faced to a huge stress, related to the language barrier, visa issues, and cultural differences with my colleagues, and some medical system differences. Therefore, to decrease the stress and negative side effects of this process we must have a strong motivation for relocation.
