1)  listen clients more
2)  let client talk more
3)  ask more accurate questions without water
4)  create bullet-list short summary after a meet and confirm it with
    the client
5)  draw more: use diagrams, any kind of visuals, figma prototypes and
    attach them later to the ticket (you can also validate them with the
    client)
6)  for complex tasks you\'ll need to force your team to create pages on
    Confluence (or any other system) with preliminary architecture
    designs, background, problem definition, proposals of different
    solutions and then let team decide what to do in particular case, or
    show this page to customer and let him to decide what to choose
7)  meet and chat with a customer or any stakeholder if you need his
    opinion, or if you need his clarification, better to ask, rather
    implement something that he would not expect you will implement
8)  keep JIRA tickets more accurate, split huge epics into small
    specified tickets related to particular problem that the weakest
    team member could solve in 1 day
9)  do more releases per day, this way you\'ll get feedback faster on
    implemented feature (or its part) and you will be able to change
    direction of its implementation when you\'ll get bad feedback on it
    on earlier stage
10) you can invest into tickets description, but truly saying it will
    not make for you much profit, bigger description - bigger PR, keep
    it small - you\'ll get faster PR, faster review, faster merge,
    faster deploy, faster feedback, faster hotfix if needed, this way it
    will work better than gather requirements for 1 week, then spent 1
    week for cool description for single ticket, then 2 weeks of
    implementation, then we do release 1 month later together with other
    features that are in wait-list\.... Uh\... scrum\... and then you
    get bad feedback and everything starts from the scratch\...
11) define KPIs for your team for quarter, month, mention the most
    desired features you want to deliver, prioritize and discuss the
    most valuable \...are you still reading??)))
12) try to setup communication not only with client, but also with end
    users using Intercom for example, this way you can get/ask feedback
    from users and then discuss it with the customer
13) document everything you get from customer, this way your team will
    be on the same page with you and what was discussed on other
    meetings they don\'t participate
14) you can also record every meeting and share it with the team
15) try to avoid personal chats in a team, avoid small group chats
    inside team, all communication should be in public channels and
    everything should be transparent, this way you can easily find
    something in Slack in future in history
16) limitations should be defined (so, think more about the scope,
    don\'t try to get too much in one go)

Tools we use:

-   Confluence as data storage
-   Slack as communication tool and also as data storage
-   Remeet (with all public meets recordings) with Slack integration
-   JIRA Kanban boards
-   Atlassian CI/CD with full cycle of automated builds, tests,
    deployments (3 releases per day in EU working hours + 2 releases in
    US working hours)
-   Lucid.app, Miro, Figma for visuals

## Example

I\'ve been assigned to the new project as a key developer (front-end).
As I know, at this point, my team will need to re-write the old legacy
UI application based on an old-fashioned JavaScript framework into a new
one using the latest company\'s UI guidelines (design system) and
ReactJS. I\'m responsible for gathering the requirements and identifying
the development process\'s starting point. It\'s my new job and new
role. Please give me the possible steps and advice how to figure out
what needs to be done and how to identify the first steps proactively. I
want to demonstrate professionalism and strong engineering skills.

### I.

> Sure, here are some steps you could take to make sure you\'re off to a
> successful and proactive start in your new role:

1.  **Understand the Legacy System:** Start by thoroughly understanding
    the legacy system - its architecture, functionalities, business
    logic, UX and UI. Learn how data flows, how state is managed and how
    different components interact. Pay attention to any pain points,
    weaknesses or redundancies that exist.

2.  **Identify Stakeholder Requirements:** Regularly communicate with
    stakeholders, which might include the product owner, project
    manager, designers, backend team, etc. Understand what their
    expectations and requirements are. Prioritize these requirements to
    create a tangible task list.

3.  **Define the Scope:** Based on your understanding and stakeholder
    requirements, define the scope of the project. This should include
    what parts will need to be re-written, what can be deprecated, and
    what new features or improvements will be added.

4.  **Architect the New Application:** Design the architecture of the
    new application. Consider using common design patterns and
    principles that are idiomatic to ReactJS. Plan your component
    structure, state management (e.g. consider using Redux or React\'s
    built-in Context API), router planning, etc. In this step, you
    should also define the coding standards, such as formatting, naming
    conventions, testing frameworks, etc.

5.  **Perform a Design Compatibility Check:** Review the old
    application\'s user interface and compare it with the new company\'s
    UI guidelines. Identify what components are reusable, what needs
    modification and what needs to be developed from scratch.

6.  **Establish Version Control Processes:** Implement a version control
    system (probably Git). Define a branching strategy, Pull Request and
    code review processes along with a CI/CD pipeline.

7.  **Begin Development:** Once everything is planned out, start the
    actual development. It\'s usually best to start with a vertical
    slice - a single feature or module end-to-end. This will help you
    identify any unforeseen issues or changes you need to address in
    your plan.

8.  **Implement Testing:** Testing is crucial. Decide on the types of
    testing that will be implemented (unit testing, integration testing,
    e2e testing etc). Write tests as you develop---this is a good
    practice, especially with big projects.

9.  **Review, Feedback, and Iterate:** As you develop, make sure to
    constantly get feedback from other team members and stakeholders.
    Perform regular code reviews. This iterative and incremental process
    helps ensure you\'re on the right track and allows for adjustments
    as necessary.

Remember, your soft skills will be equally important in this new role.
Be a good listener, collaborate effectively, and make sure to clearly
communicate with your team members and stakeholders frequently. Good
luck!

> And how to demonstrate my engagement, professionalism, and strong
> engineering skills during this process?

You can demonstrate your engagement, professionalism, and strong
engineering skills in the following ways:

1.  **Take Initiative:** Proactively identify problems and propose
    possible solutions. Don't wait for tasks to be assigned to you. This
    shows your enthusiasm and engagement.

2.  **Communicate Effectively:** Regularly update your team and
    stakeholders about the project\'s progress. Clear, concise, and open
    communication is key in showing your professionalism.

3.  **Follow Good Coding Practices:** Write clean, efficient and
    maintainable code. Following best practices and standards in your
    coding shows your strong engineering skills. This includes following
    a standardized coding style, writing useful comments, and
    structuring your code well. Make sure your code is tested and
    documented.

4.  **Emphasize on Learning and Improvement:** Show your willingness to
    learn new technologies, tools, or methodologies. Stay updated with
    the latest trends in technology. This shows that you are adaptable
    and committed to continuous improvement.

5.  **Be a Team Player:** Assist your team members when they face
    challenges and appreciate their help when you need it. Participate
    actively in team meetings and discussions. Being collaborative and
    supportive is important in a professional setting.

6.  **Show Responsibility:** Meet your deadlines, and if you foresee a
    delay, communicate it in advance with a valid reason and a plan to
    make up for it. Take responsibility for any mistakes and treat them
    as opportunities to learn.

7.  **Focus on User Experience:** Always consider the end-user\'s
    perspective when designing and developing the application. This
    demonstrates your in-depth understanding and consideration for the
    user experience.

8.  **Ask for Feedback:** A good professional values feedback. Regularly
    ask for feedback from your peers, supervisors, and underlings to
    know your areas of improvement.

Remember, at the end of the day, your work will speak for itself! So
focus on delivering high-quality, efficient solutions and the rest will
follow.
