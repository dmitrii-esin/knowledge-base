Additional Tips:

* You can adjust the columns and their names based on your specific needs.

* Use colors or conditional formatting to highlight different statuses or priorities.

* Add additional sheets for specific areas like technical details, design mockups, or testing plans.

* Utilize tools like formulas and automation to streamline calculations and updates.

* Consider using project management software that integrates with spreadsheets for more advanced features.

Remember, the best structure depends on your project's unique needs and preferences. Choose the one that helps you visualize the application's components, track progress, and manage development effectively.
