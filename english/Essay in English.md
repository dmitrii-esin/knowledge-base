# Essay 

## How to write a CAE essay?
An essay is the first part of the writing and it is obligatory.

You need to answer the question with between 220-260 words. In the text, you need to analyse a question using different points of view. It is a semi-formal text and should be impartial until the conclusion. What the examiner wants to see is a balanced argument that is both interesting and easy to read.

## A good essay contains the following parts:

Introduction<br />
Introduce the topic and say what you are going to talk about and capture the interest of the reader with a question, a fact or an extreme opinion.

1 st paragraph<br />
The first point from the notes (you can mix points if they are related). This should be your main point, you must justify why it is the most important.

2 nd paragraph<br />
The 2nd point from the notes, you need to link it to the first. Explain why it is of secondary importance.

3 rd paragraph<br />
This is optional and can be linked to the second paragraphs. It explains the final point and links to the others.

Conclusion<br />
A summary of what you have said in the main paragraphs and make your main point. It must be interesting and the reader should learn something from it.

Language<br />
This is an advanced piece of writing, so make sure your choice of language reflects it. You will get marked for accuracy, however, occasional errors can still be present as long as they do not impede understanding. So don’t play it too safe. This is your opportunity to show what you can do, so take some risks and have fun with it!

Vocabulary<br />
In the writing paper you should use a range of vocabulary, including less common lexis. Brainstorm some vocabulary related to the topic. Take your time to think of nouns and compound nouns that you know at C1 level. Really let your vocabulary sparkle.

## Examples

Subject:<br />
Your class has attended a panel discussion on facilities which should receive money from local authorities. You have made the notes below:

Which facilities should receive money from local authorities?<br />
museums<br />
sports centres<br />
public gardens<br />

Some opinions expressed in the discussion:<br />
“Museums aren’t popular with everybody!”<br />
“Sports centres mean healthier people.”<br />
“A town needs green spaces – parks are great for everybody.”<br />
Write an essay discussing two of the facilities in your notes. You should explain which facility it is more important for local authorities to give money to, giving reasons in support of your answer.

### Student’s CAE Essay Answer:

Introduction

In regard of a recent discussion about the facilities, which are financially supported by local authorities, I would like to write a few of my personal thoughts. Whether we are talking about sports centres or public gardens, there is no doubt that they are both a good thing to have in the city and should both be supported somehow. The only question then is which one of these is more important, what are the pros and cons of each one?

1 st body paragraph 

Let me start with the sport centres as I think these are a bit more problematic. Obviously, in our times where lots of people spend days sitting in their office staring at a computer, some sort of physical training is very important. We have to balance that shift in our lifestyles. The problem I see with supporting the sports centres is the number of activities that you can do at these days. There is almost countless list of either individual or team sports that we can think of, and each centre is usually designed for a specific type or at least a group of sports similar in its nature. Therefore I think that it is too difficult to support them equally and we can’t say which activity is better than the others either. Another reason for not financing sports as much as green parks is their commercial use. What I mean by that is that we usually pay for everything the centre offers us to do and therefore they are more able to last from their own money than gardens.

2 nd body paragraph 

Regarding of the green spaces, the situation is much clearer I think. Every city needs gardens where people can sit and relax, but nobody is going to pay a tax for just walking around.

Conclusion

These factors lead me to my conclusion, that the public gardens are definitely a facility which should be financed from public money, whereas in the case of sports centres, the situation is questionable.

Subject:<br />
Your class has attended a panel discussion on the action governments can take to promote health and fitness among young people. You have made the notes below.

Action to promote health and fitness among young people<br />
improve teaching in schools.<br />
improves attitudes to competitiveness.<br />
improve the image of sports.<br />
Some opinions expressed during the discussion

‘There need to be specialist sports teachers for children and students of all ages.’<br />
‘Some young people are put off by the pressure to compete.’<br />
‘A lot of young people don’t think it’s cool to take part in sports.’<br />
Write an essay for your tutor, discussing two of the actions in your notes. You should explain which action you think is more important, giving reasons to support your opinion.<br />

### Student’s CAE Essay Answer:

Introduction

We often hear about the many benefits of health and fitness. However, less often do we hear concrete suggestions for how to improve participation rates, particularly among young people. In this essay I will discuss two possible actions that governments could focus on in order to promote health and fitness to youth today.

1 st body paragraph 

The first possible action is to improve physical education teaching in schools. Local students have at times complained that the curriculum is rigid and emphasizes repetitive activities instead of team sports and enjoyment. Better role models and more adventurous options could lead to improved attitude and participation. Naturally, employing specialist sports teachers would incur considerable cost.

2 nd body paragraph 

A second option would be to attempt to change the overly competitive attitudes that seem ingrained in many of the sports competitions for youngsters. When adults such as parents and teachers focus on winning above having a good time, it puts undue pressure on the participants. They may feel a sense of failure if they lose and also be less inclined to try a new sport.

Conclusion

In summary, either approach would be a step in the right direction. In my view, it would be wise to prioritize dealing with reducing competitiveness first because I believe it would help young people feel better about the sports they already do. They could then, in turn, influence their friends to join in.

### Final Notes<br />
1. Overuse of "very."<br />
Be careful not to overuse the word "very." You may be penalised for exaggerating a point in your
essay, so use this word sparingly to qualify another adjective or adverb.<br />
2. The word "thing"<br />
A lot of confusion arises, and a lot of bad style arises, from the way students use the word "thing."
Avoid this word as much as possible and replace it as often as possible with the name of whatever
you are referring to.<br />
Examples:<br />
x One thing that needs to be said...<br />
-> One point that needs to be made... <br />
x Many things can be said against trade unions.<br />
-> One can criticise trade unions for the fact that...<br />
3. Style and grammar<br />
a. "And..."... "But..."<br />
Avoid starting a sentence with "And' or "But." Although there are instances where one might do so, it
is generally not such a good idea.<br />
b. "-ing"<br />
Avoid starting a sentence with an "-ing" form. Although there are instances where this is possible, most
students get these structures wrong, so unless you are absolutely certain about what you are doing,
keep to more standard structures.<br />
c. Commas, and "that"<br />
Typically German phrases that contain a "..., dass" do NOT contain commas in English.<br />
Examples:<br />
DE: Es ist klar, dass... (with comma)<br />
GB: It is clear that... (No comma)<br />
DE: Man muss auch zugeben, dass...<br />
GB: One has to admit that...<br />

## My example:

### I

Nowadays, we can observe how rapidly world changing is. According to that we can extract the steps to following them on our own. In regard to this topic I want to analyse some facts and express them to our daily routine for producing more productive experience.

Initially, I want to check up current situation in career path growing in the context of todays world needs. A lot of areas have demand in strong specialists in science, medicine and technology. Therefore, we can make assumption that we don't require the huge amount of low-qualified workers but we need to teach more high-qualified specialists.
After that, I want to highlight that we can't forget about our passions and hobbies because that can affect our wok-life balance and destroy our career in the future.<br />
Then, I suggest to use this information to analyse and generate the plan for growing for our children and ourselves as an initial step of integration to new reality.

To sum up my essay, I want to share with you my thoughts about building our career path for being in demand in the future. My advice is analysing world situation, then generating personal plan based on this data and our personal abilities and interests in order to support our work-life balance in prospect.

### II
In this essay I would like to share some bits of my thoughts about online communication. 
Nowadays, we faced to separation from each other and forced to communicate remotely.
Next I want to extract pros and cons from this situation and highlight that how we can deal with it in more comfortable and productive form.

Initially, I’m going to highlight the pros and cons of online communication.<br />
The plus side is ability to communicate with another person anytime anywhere. We have no limiеs thanks to Zoom, Skype, Slack and other tools.<br />
The downside is… loosing the focus. Due to increasing information channels our working capacity is decreasing. 

Then, I want say that each person required different amount of daily communications and we should keep in mind that fact. For example, manager’s routine consists of 80% communications and engineer’s routine includes only 20%, but that depends on situation. <br />
Next I provide advice how we can extract advantages and avoid disadvantages by that fact.

Last but not least, I would suggest to generate the plan of our daily routine depending on our requirements by booking meetings and other working activities using calendar and our communication tools.

To wrap up, I remind that, online communications comes from pros and cons.<br />
We can extract advantages and avoid disadvantages by planning our work.<br />
By doing so our work became more comfortable and productive.
