# **how to explain to manager that you are blocked because of infrastructure is down if you are a sr. software engineer working on POC**

1. Be Clear and Concise: Briefly explain the specific infrastructure issue you're facing and its impact on your POC progress. Avoid technical jargon unless your manager understands it. Example: "I'm currently blocked on the POC because the \[specific system/service\] is down. This prevents me from completing \[specific task related to POC\]."

2. Highlight Your Proactive Efforts: Briefly mention any troubleshooting steps you've already taken. Show you've made an effort before seeking help. Example: "I've checked the system status page and contacted the IT support team, but the issue persists."

3. Suggest Alternative Solutions (if feasible): Depending on the situation, offer alternative solutions or workarounds if possible. Demonstrate initiative and problem-solving skills. Example: "While the infrastructure is down, I could focus on \[alternative task within the POC\] or document the current process to prepare for when the system is back online."

4. Set Clear Expectations: Estimate the time impact of the downtime on your POC timeline. Be realistic and transparent. Example: "Based on the IT team's estimated repair time, I expect a delay of \[X days\] in completing the POC."

5. Offer to Keep Them Updated: Express your commitment to keeping them informed of any progress or changes related to the situation. Example: "I'll continue to monitor the situation and update you as soon as I have more information or the infrastructure is back up."
