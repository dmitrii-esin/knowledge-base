**Task**  
\- reasons the current plan needs improvements  
\- benefits you have now  
\- benefits that should be introduced

**Plan**  
1\. Reason  
\- Lack of "Benefit B"  
2\. Problem  
\- We have "Benefit A", but we don't have "Benefit B"  
3\. Suggestion  
\- "Benefit B" reinforces the value of "Benefit A"  
4\. Recap  
\- Having only "Benefit A" is good but having "Benefit A" and "Benefit B" is great

**Proposal**  
What I wanted to highlight here is the lack of "Psychological support" among our medical coverage plans. 

It was comfortable to have a huge list of medical coverage plans like vision and dental plans. However, what we observe among our employees now is psychological burnout. At the same time, we don't have any solutions to help.

It might be a sign that I have to suggest including "Psychological support" in the list of our employee benefits. It might be a good idea to have a completed list of medical coverage plans for our employees because this new plan reinforces all our benefits. 

Taking all of this into account we could say that we can take care (take responsibility?) for a healthy workspace in our company.
