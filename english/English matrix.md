If you are conducting an interview with a non-English speaking candidate, it is important to check English level properly as it shows whether they can communicate with customers or not.  

### **CEFR English levels**

The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) divides learners into three broad divisions that can be divided into six levels; for each level, it describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing. These levels are:  

| Level |  | General description |
| :---: | :---: | ----- |
| **Basic user** | **A1** | Can communicate in basic English with help from the listener |
|  | **A2** | Can communicate in English within a limited range of contexts |
| **Independent user** | **B1** | Can communicate essential points and ideas in familiar contexts |
|  | **B2** | Can use English effectively, with some fluency, in a range of contexts |
| **Proficient user** | **C1** | Able to use English fluently and flexibly in a wide range of contexts |
|  | **C2** | Highly proficient \- can use English very fluently, precisely and sensitively in most contexts |

If the candidate's native language is **not English**, do not forget to **allocate 5-10 minutes** to determine the candidate's English level. **Ask both technical and questions.**

### **How to evaluate level correctly**

First, ask the candidate some general questions, for example:

* What’s your job? What are you studying?  
* What do you do in your job/on your course?  
* What does your company do? What kind of company do you work for?  
* Why do you need English? When did you start learning English? What suggestions would you give to someone who wants to learn English?

Then move on to the questions and discussion points listed in the B1 Level Section. If the candidate answers effectively and confidently, choose questions from the same or a higher level. As the candidate becomes less communicative, choose questions or discussion points from a lower level until you establish the level of questioning or discussion a candidate can confidently handle.

Please remember that it is **not the questions** that determine the English level, but **how the candidate answers these questions.**

Have a **discussion** with your candidates: ask questions on **various topics**, evaluate **how they answer**, and **how they move from topic to topic.**
