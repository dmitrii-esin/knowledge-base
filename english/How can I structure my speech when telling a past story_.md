Recently one of my students who has been preparing for technical assessment has asked me:

**“How can I structure my speech when telling a past story?”** 🤔

Grab the recipe below \*\*\*\*😉 You can use the well-known STAR approach with a tweak:

🌟S \- **Situation** \- Set the **context** of your story (use the **past continuous)**

🌟T \- **Task** \- Describe your **role** back then and some **challenges** (use the **past simple**)

🌟A \- **Action** \- Highlight **how** you **overcame the challenge** (the **past simple**)

🌟R \- **Result** \- Explain the **positive effect** of **your** actions (use the **past simple**)

❣️  ***Lesson*** \- *Tell what you learnt from this experience (use the present perfect)*

*NB: the tenses can vary*

**SAMPLE STORY**

🌟S \- Situation

*Two years ago my team was **working on** a very important project with a tight deadline. The stakes were high and the atmosphere was tense as we were trying to meet our client's expectations.*

🌟T \- Task

*Back then, my role was to ensure the project was completed on time and within budget. However, the client **had moving goal posts** often, altering requirements and expectations frequently. This made it difficult to stick to our initial plan and caused significant stress for the entire team.*

🌟A \- Action

*Faced with these challenges, I decided it was time to **turn over a new leaf** in our approach. I organized a series of urgent meetings with the client to align our understanding and set firm boundaries for further changes. Internally, I restructured the team's workflow to **sharpen up** our act and enhance efficiency.*

🌟R \- Result

*As a result of these actions, we completed the project on schedule and received high praise from the client for our adaptability and commitment. The project turned out to be a tremendous success, achieving all set objectives.*

❣️ Lesson

*From this experience, **I have learned** the importance of clear communication and setting boundaries, especially when dealing with changing client requirements. I've also realized the value of being adaptable and keeping a cool head under pressure. These lessons have been invaluable in my subsequent projects and management roles.*

Practice telling past stories with this approach for 5 minutes when you have time and this will help you not only to prepare for **technical assessment** or **project interviews** but it will also improve your **discourse management.** 🤓
