APPS

* [https://www.macmillaneducationapps.com/soundspron/](https://www.macmillaneducationapps.com/soundspron/) I have been using it for quite some time. Easy-to-use, paid upgrades but the free version goes a long way; BrE and AmE charts   
* [https://forvo.com/](https://forvo.com/) It's got an app as well.   
* [Sounds app from British Council](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.britishcouncil.phonemicchart&hl=en) \- I prefer the Macmillan's, but, you know, matter of taste ![ðŸ™‚][image1]
