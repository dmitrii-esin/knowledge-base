Move to appropriate place:  
A few rules for negotiating in critical situations from me  
1\) never admit your guilt, make the client doubt your guilt, refer to the technical specifications, where this case was not described explicitly. Hint to the client that his employees were not interested in the result \- they received money for 3 days and did not notice anything, etc.  
2\) Refer to the contract, read it carefully before negotiations.  
3\) make the client remember the good in your previous work with him, transfer the conversation to past positive experience, promise that we will cope with all the problems together.  
4\) remember the moments when the client made a mistake and you helped him  
5\) In this particular case, remember the overbooking and hint that the company did not suffer losses, but only reputational risks  
6\) do not forget to praise the client, emphasize his stability and good reputation, hint that litigation is unlikely to help the image, ask to reduce the degree of negotiations and move on to constructive ones.w
