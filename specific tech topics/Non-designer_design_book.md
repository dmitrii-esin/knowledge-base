**Non-designer design book**

### **The four basic principles**

The following is a brief overview of the basic principles of design that
appear in every well-designed piece of work. Although I discuss each one
of these principles separately, keep in mind they are really
interconnected. Rarely will you apply only one principle.

#### **Contrast**

The idea behind contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are
merely *similar.* If the elements (type, color, size, line thickness,
shape, space, etc.) are not the *same,* then make them **very
different.** Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a
page---it's what makes a reader look at the page in the first place. It
also clarifies the communication.

#### **Repetition**

Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can
repeat colors, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line
thicknesses, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts, etc. This develops the
organization and strengthens the unity.

#### **Alignment**

Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should
have some visual connection with another element on the page. This
creates a clean and sophisticated look.

#### **Proximity**

Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When
several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one
visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organize
information, reduces clutter, and gives the reader a clear structure.
