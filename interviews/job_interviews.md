# Job interview

## Main focus in all interviews

1.  Client -\> 2. Company -\> 3. Me

## Greetings and introduction

I\'m Dmitry, from Moscow, Russia, I\'m 34.\
I\'m graduated from university in 2010 as a civil lawyer, but some years
after that I changed my profession and transitioned to software
development.\
Currently I work as a software engineer and focused on UI and AWS
infrastructure.\
My favorite interests and passions are technology, self-development,
meditation, riding, hiking, trekking, traveling.

## General role and professional focus

My role is the software engineer and I mainly focused on the front-end
development. I have good expertise in UI and UX area in context of
designing, implementing and maintaining user interfaces. I\'m familiar
with some frameworks and tools (like Typescript, React, Redux, Mobx,
Jest) and fundamental knowledge related to my professional area (like
basics of algorithms and data structures and final automata theory).
Also I successful refined my communication skills and self-organization
practices.

## Education

I\'m graduated from Moscow Social-Econimics institute in 2010 as a
\"civil lawyer\". But some years after that I\'ve changed my profession
by the books, online courses, pet projects and other types of
self-education.

## Career path and skills

I\'ve started my carrer in IT for 6 years ago as a content-manager in
game-dev company named Gaijin. On this step I executed my communication
skills with the managers and engineers of distributed services like
Steam and Sony PlayStation Store. Then, after 1 year I transitioned my
profession to software development as a frontend developer. I spent the
last 5 years for this role in different projects. I worked on big CRM
system named Roistat, which provides comfortable user interface with
data visualization for business founders, which helped them to optimize
advertising costs. In addition to this I dealt with administration
panels and monitoring desk for internal needs of employees in Beeline
telecommunication provider. One of the most interesting project, which I
worked on, is the user interface for the data-science platform in one of
the biggest banks, named \"Sder data-science\" (SberDS). This system
provides comfortable interface for validators of models and graphic
engine for the interaction with models and trees of models. Working on
my previous projects I've acquired considerable experience in technical
skills and communication skills. The main of these technical skills are
working with frontned-framaworks for building user interfaces (for
example ReactJS, Redux, Ant.Design and Material-UI). In addition to this
I\'m quiet comfortable with the most relevant engineering practices like
TDD, pair programming and WBS (work breakdown structure), which helps
engineers to plan and implement complex features. Also, I\'m familiar
with the most famous programming technics like OOP, FP, MVC, Design
patterns. So, I have experience in working on different platform with
different languages (JavaScript on The client-side, Elixir and Phoenix
on server-side). In addition to technical skills I\'m refined my
communication skills. As you can see in my resume I work in different
companies with different types of people. I dealt with time estimation,
receiving permission, work coordination. I think one of the most
important part of my job is the problem solving. Sometimes to solve the
problem we need to receive requirements from manager or designer,
sometimes is the negotiating about alternative solutions, instead of
coding. To sum up all of this: my general focus currently is on the
implementing, designing and maintaining comfortable UI which solve
specific business problem and I\'m interested in team-working, exploring
new areas and unfamiliar environments and using engineering technics
which help us to deliver more stable and maintainable software.

## Why you need to choose me / Why you are the best candidate

I. Because I\'m responsible for solving problems even if I haven\'t
experience to deal with it. Initially, I look for doing research and
receive requirements about the result, then I try to construct the plan
of solving this problem by the WBS. After that, I\'m ready to implement
this decision or I look assistance for that. II. Because, I have huge
experience in relevant technologies for your project (TS, React, AWS).\
Additionally, I very confident in my communication skills (SDLS, Agile)
and high level of self-organization (time-management, GTD, Pomodoro)
bacause am I a good team player.\
I think I can provide strong value, favor and profit for your clients if
you choose me.

## My strengths

I\'m ready to provide my tech skills and strong self-organization
practices. I mainly responsible for reviewing information and
requirements, planning my work, communication with the team, implement
and deliver features.

## My weaknesses \\ Have you ever did a mistake? How to you handle it?

I. In past I had a problem with the estimation process. My estimations
was very optimistic (and this risk calld underestimate problem). I
provided very short estimation for the tasks. As a result, my team could
not meet the deadline. In this situation I learn that the estimation
shoul include all steps of performing feature: collecting requirement,
research, allocationg time for involving additional specialists, fixing
bugs and risk. And now I can conduct estimation process with the mosts
accurate value as much as possible.

II\. By working on the more perfect solution I could dive deeper and
forget about time. Because of involving in the flow. Consequently, I
could finish work when it\'s already dark outside. It\'s decreased my
energy and it was not good for my work-life balance. But today, I prefer
using some self-organization practics for the time-management and work
organization like GTD and Pomodoro technic. By doing so I improved my
productivity and quality of life.

## Why I choose programming

Because when I was a child, I liked playing Lego constructors,
videogames, sci-fi and computers. These activities gives me interests to
explore the programming in the future.

## Why I change your profession \\ why you switch

By working as a lawyer I couldn\'t realize my own skills and passions.
But by expanding new area trhough the switching into SD I became really
interested and inspired by my new profession.

## Why I choose this company

This domain is very interesting for me. I find this product very useful
and perspective. Also, I have a lot of appropriate skills for this job
and I see great opportunities in working in your company.

## Give an example of hard situation or challenge

Situtaion in the bank related to unrealistic deadline. I implemented
fast but ugly code. As a resul I met the deadline and improved ugly code
then. What I lernt - inlude all steps on estimation phase.

## Give an example of working in team\\alone

When I worked on my previous project I was working alone as a front-end
developer and I was responsible for implementing UI for the new feature
named \"reporting\" for the big data-science platform. The main task was
to use features from another parts of this application and imagine the
results of its working as a charts, tables and other widgets. Through
the all steps of process I faced with unfamiliar code and dangerous
environments, but my tech experience and communication skills helped me
to receive all necessary information and knowledge for the implementing
this feature. As a result I met all AC, solved all problems, delivered
the MVP and the customer was pleased with the result.

## Could you describe the last achievement of your team? What was your personal input to this success?

On my previous project I\'ve faced with the unfamiliar environment. Our
customer wanted us to implement the feature, which allow user to
dowloand the result of working our application as a pdf file. And my
personal input was to search the solution for it and provide the
implementation for this feature. I organized my work by several steps:
on the first step I look for technology for this. I was desiced to
choose puppeter - nodejs api which uses google chrome browser in
headless mode for visiting sites and downloading the pages as a files.
On the next step I planned my work and prepared working prototype for
the demo. As a result I implemented and delivered the UI and served-side
approach which provides the customer this functionality.

## Tell me about a time when you had to use your presentation skills to influence someone's opinion?

Early in my carreer I was working on the project with UI for the DS
platform. I was responsible for preparing the demo stands and show the
results of our team work. During this process I provide the quality and
advanteges of our solutions for the customers. As a result I improved my
presentation skills.

## What are your goals?

My short term goal - intergation in new title and role by integration in
new project team and new community, collecting information and planning
the furter steps. My mid term goal - taking an new roles and
responisbilities (Team-leading, Software Achitechture or Resourse
Management), bacause I look for expaning my abilities and personality.

## Describe a situation in which you found that your results were not up to your customer's expectations. What happened? What action did you take?

Hello. I'm going to tell you about a situation when my results not up to
my customer\'s expectations and my actions for handle with it. At the
begining of this year I was involved in the project, which provides UI
for the data-science platform. My team was expected to realize the
feature which visualizes the reporting page of this application. This
task was estimated for 2 weeks. I had to accept this conditions and we
challenged to meet the deadline. I orginized the work on this feature. I
suggest to involve additional specialists from another team, because we
hadn\'t time and resources. I really strived to meet the daedline by
following up to all rules related to time-management and engineering
practices. Unfortunately, we faced up with barriers related to different
interfaces of our complex system. This feature take time more then we
have and out customer was very disappointed by this eccident. Later, we
fixed all problems by well-coordinated teamwork and deliver our feture
in high quality. As I look back on this experience, I lernt that the
defining the point of view and recieving extra-tme for the bug fixing
during time-esimation process is a very impotant thing for a good
result.

## Give me an example about you reached the goal and how to you achieved this?

Let me see\... Working alone on the Sber.DS Resporting Changing
profession Learning English Relocation Another challenges\...

## Tell me about an example of your working style?

Before I start the work I write the plan, receive additional info if i
need that and time estimate. If I see the barrier or frustration - I
look for resolve it. Situational, proactive.

## My questions

I\'d like to ask\... Who are the key developers of this project? Which
developers are on the team? What is the main tool of this project are?
How are your team will check the results? Which developers Will I work
with?
