⏱️ As humans, we are incredibly bad at estimating time. We tend to be too optimistic, and as a result, we are often delayed and run multiple projects at a time. Let’s fix it\! Here are some simple strategies that help me estimate better ↓

✅ Estimate with 6–6.5 productive hours per day.  
✅ Take the time to break down the scope of work.  
✅ Always estimate in ranges, never in precise numbers.  
✅ Always add at at least 15% of buffer time.  
✅ Estimate delivery for a fixed scope of work.  
✅ Explain that scope changes are expensive and will cause delays.  
✅ Every new team member speeds up the process by 1.5–1.8×.  
✅ Life is full of surprises, so explore unknowns as much as possible.  
✅ Include over-delivery in your (personal) estimates.  
✅ Always try to get the work done well, and a little bit ahead of time.

This isn’t going to work always, but it will give you a bit more time without late night sessions and last minute changes.
